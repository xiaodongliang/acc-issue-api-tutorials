#  Get Issue Data

This page describes how to sort it out with the issue data e.g.
- get meaningful name of issue sub type and root causes
- get assignee, watcher
- get list of issue comments
- get linked document information
- get attachments (TBD)
- get references (TBD)

finally build an array of issue with those data that are exported.
